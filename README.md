# Let's Build Swift

## Short, simple, automated steps for building Swift

So you'd like to build Swift on Linux? Perhaps to hack on the compiler or on the corelibs re-implementation of Foundation, or just because you're curious? But it seems like it's complicated to setup and you just want to get it working right now?

These scripts are here to help. They will provision a substantial EC2 machine, and build Swift on plain vanilla Ubuntu in less than one hour.

How to do it:

1a. EITHER, ensure you have the Amazon's AWS command line tools
   intallaed (`brew install awscli`), and configured with suitable
   credentials, and then update the script `create_instance.bash` to
   refer to your AWS ssh key and to your desired EC2 security
   groups. Then, run `create_instance.bash`
   
1b. OR, go to your cloud provider of choice and create an instance as follows:

    - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (e.g., the AWS `ami-0f26d4c9992650142`)
    - at least 128 GB of disk on the main filesystem
    - optimized for compute 
    
      If you are using AWS, a `c4.8xlarge` is a good choice. If you go
      with something much lighter, like a `m3.medium`, it will take
      many hours (over 10?) to run a full build and test cycle. The
      tests alone take over 10 minutes on a c4.

2. upload this repo to the instance.

3. run `./go-all.sh --tag "swift-4.2-RELEASE"` in order to build the
   Swift 4.2 release build.
   
   What if you want to build something else?
   
   The arguments to `go-all.sh` are simply appended to a call to
   `swift/utils/update-checkout --clone`. That script's help output
   can provide more guidance on different arguments it accepts. If you
   provide no arguments, the default behavior is to build the HEAD of
   master. This may or may not work. You can also specify build
   "schemes", using a format like `--scheme <schemename>`. I am no
   expert. The only thing I have seen build completely successfully is
   a release tag.

4. wait!

There is no 5th step.

If you don't want to have to maintain the network connection while these scripts are running, you might first run `tmux` after logging in in order to do all this work in a tmux session. You can detach from the tmux by doing `C-b d`, and attach to it again by doing `tmux attach`.

## What this does.

These are just scripts which automate the instructions from the Swift website. 

## Compatibility

This is known good on Ubuntu 16.04.5.

## Resources

I don't know much about building the Swift compiler. These resources seem like good starting points:

- [Apple's README on building Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift)
- [Harlan Haskins & Robert Widmann - Becoming An Effective Contributor to Swift - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGJKsp-pZPk)
- [Swift CI Server, showing what is expeced to build](https://ci.swift.org)
- [forum thread on contributing](https://forums.swift.org/t/what-should-i-learn-if-i-want-to-contribute-to-the-swift-compiler/18144)
- [modocacheâ€™s notes](https://modocache.io/getting-started-with-swift-development)


## Also, docker

If you want to install a current version of Docker on your ubuntu box, there's also a script for that. You could even do the entire build within a docker container. Or you could run the constituent scripts within a docker container and commit the image after each step, if you wanted the ability to rollback the filesystem. 

I have not tested this recentl!
